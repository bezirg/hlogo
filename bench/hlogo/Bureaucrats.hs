-- | Imagine an N-by-N grid of office desks and a bureaucrat sitting at each. A folder
-- is randomly assigned to one desk. The bureaucrat does nothing until four or more folders are
-- on his desk at which time he sends one to each of his four nearest neighbors. Any bureaucrat
-- sitting at the edge of this array throws a folder out the window if there is no desk to send
-- it to. Sometimes, adding one folder can cause multiple redistributions of folders as one
-- bureaucratâ€™s actions causes neighbors to exceed three folders, which then ripples through
-- the office. In principle, just adding one new folder might involve redistribution at every
-- desk, sometimes multiple times.
-- A yellow cell indicates two folders on the desk, a blue cell is zero, green one, and red three folders. The 100x100 model will automatically stop after 5000 model steps if you leave it running.
-- Setup to 2 folders per bureaucrat.
-- At each go, one random bureaucrat is sent one new folder.
-- Options: max-pxcor: 99, max-pycor: 99, no-hwrap,no-vwrap
-- Adapted from Bureaucrats-fast.nlogo
